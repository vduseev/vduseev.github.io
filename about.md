# About me
I'm Vagiz Duseev (Russian: Ваги́з Дусе́ев), a programmer and idealist.

As a **programmer**, I write mostly in Python, but also Java and C++. Here are [my favorite books](/2018-01-24-favorite-software-books), and detailed description of [my work environment](2018-01-25-work-environment).

During my time in the university I was fascinated by 3D game engines and wrote a couple of [my own implementations](https://github.com/vduseev/asami-graphics-engine). I did a decent amount of C++ coding, mostly in Qt/QML. Among the projects developed back then are [kinect depth data filtration](https://github.com/vduseev/kinect-depth-data-filtering) library (published a [white paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6986855/?reload=true)), [high level wrapper for kinect](https://github.com/vduseev/browspot-kinect-library), [visual emulator of ext3, xfs, and ntfs systems](https://github.com/vduseev/file-systems-visual-emulator), and an [interactive sandbox station](http://nolink), which was presented at 9th CDIO Conference in 2013, at MIT, USA.

I later moved to Poland, and have been part of [SRI Infotech](http://sriinfotech.com) team, working as a lead project developer of the entitlement security system for a large financial institution up until Fall of 2017.
