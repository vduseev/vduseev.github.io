# About me
<img src="https://image.ibb.co/e4E6kH/vduseev_blog_photo.jpg" align="right" width="200" style="margin: 0px 20px">
I'm Vagiz Duseev (Russian: Ваги́з Дусе́ев), a software development engineer.

As a **programmer**, I write mostly in Python, but also Java, Ruby and C++. Here are [my favorite books](/favorite-software-books), and detailed description of [my work environment](/work-environment).

I'm mostly engaged in personal open-source projects. Check out these **hot** projects:

* `jekyll-dry` – Don't Repeat Yourself plugin for Jekyll that lets reuse content across your website. **(Ruby)**
* `fate` – Framework for Algorithm Testing designed to speed up and simplify problem solving for such sites as HackerRank.com. **(Python)**
* `ipvanish` – Command line tool for VPN provider "IPVanish". **(Python)**
* `preserve-layout-plugin` – IntelliJ IDEA plugin that allows you to import and export menu layouts. **(Java)**

During my time in the university I was fascinated by 3D game engines and wrote a couple of [my own implementations](https://github.com/vduseev/asami-graphics-engine). I did a decent amount of C++ coding, mostly in Qt/QML. Among the projects developed back then are [kinect depth data filtration](https://github.com/vduseev/kinect-depth-data-filtering) library (published a [white paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6986855/?reload=true)), [high level wrapper for kinect](https://github.com/vduseev/browspot-kinect-library), [visual emulator of ext3, xfs, and ntfs systems](https://github.com/vduseev/file-systems-visual-emulator), and an [interactive sandbox station](http://nolink), which was presented at 9th CDIO Conference in 2013, at MIT, USA.

I later moved to Poland, and have been part of [SRI Infotech](http://sriinfotech.com) team, working as a lead project developer of the entitlement security system for a large financial institution up until Fall of 2017.
