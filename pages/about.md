I'm Vagiz Duseev (Russian: Ваги́з Дусе́ев), a software engineer.

I write mostly in `Python`, but also speak `SQL`, `C++`, `Java`, `Ruby`, `C#`, and `bash`. I started coding when I was 11 years old with the help of the mentors in the local youth center. 
My first project was a [Battle City][battle-city] clone written using Borland Delphi 7. 
I continued with developing mods for the games like *GTA: San Andreas* and *Half-Life: 2*. 
In 2009 I started learning `C++` and `C#`, and then spent significant time developing all kinds of projects using `C++/Qt/OpenGL` and `.Net` stacks.
I am still quite comfortable in *C++*, despite the current focus on *Python*.

I consider myself a reasonably experienced developer with a particular interest in the automation of all stages of software development: design, implementation, testing, and delivery. Topics like *CI/CD*, *Documentation Driven Development*, *Test Driven Development*, *Agile*, or *Project Planning* are a sure way to engage me into an hours-long conversation.

I live in [Gdansk, Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gda%C5%84sk). My home town is *Tomsk, Russia*. For a brief period I also lived in *New York City*.
