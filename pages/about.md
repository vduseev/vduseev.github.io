I'm Vagiz Duseev (Russian: Ваги́з Дусе́ев), a software development engineer.

As a **programmer**, I write mostly in Python, but also Java, Ruby, and C++. Here are [my favorite books](/favorite-software-books), and detailed description of [my work environment](/work-environment).

I'm highly passionate about solving real problems with open-source projects. Check out these **hotties**:

* [`jekyll-dry`][jekyll-dry] – Don't Repeat Yourself plugin for Jekyll that lets you reuse any content across your website. **(Ruby)**
* [`fate`][fate] – Framework for Algorithm Testing designed to speed up and simplify problem solving for such sites as HackerRank.com. **(Python)**
* [`ipvanish`][ipvanish] – Command line tool for VPN provider "IPVanish". **(Python)**
* [`preserve-layout-plugin`][preserve-layout-plugin] – IntelliJ IDEA plugin that allows you to import and export menu layouts. **(Java)**
