Hi, I'm Vagiz Duseev.

I'm a software architect.
I live in [Gdansk, Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gda%C5%84sk).

## Projects

* [`ilexconf`](https://github.com/ilexconf/ilexconf) *(Python)*

  IlexConf is a lightweight configuration management library for Python. It solves the problem
  of multiple source of configuration: config files, command line args, environment variables,
  setting files in multiple formats, etc.

  Check it out! It makes working with configs **so much easier**.

* [`wutch`](https://github.com/vduseev/wutch) *(Python)*

  Wutch is a Live Server which is able to: watch for changes in given directories, run a
  shell command on each change, and display results from a different build directory in a browser.

  It was written for Sphinx but can work with Jekyll and other static site generators
  as well. The cool thing about it is that it **automatically refreshes the webpage**
  on each build.

* [`dbload`](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/db-load-generator) *(Python)*

  DBLoad is a load generator for SQL databases. It support every database that has a JDBC driver.
  You can use it to write and run scenarios that simulate real world load in the databases.

* [`ded`](https://github.com/vduseev/ded) *(Python)*

  Ded is a dependency de-duplication post renderer for Helm 3. Feed it as a post-renderer to Helm
  and it will remove duplicated dependencies from deployment Helm generates during installation.

  Extremely useful if you want to **split your Helm charts into small reusable blocks**.

**No longer maintained**

* [`Interactive sandbox`][sandbox] *(C++, OpenGL, GLSL, OpenNI, OpenCV)*

  Educational station with interactive sand, built with Kinect, custom graphics engine, water simulation,
  and developed as a university project. Sandbox has been presented at CDIO-2013 in MIT, Boston
  ([NVIDIA's article][sandbox-nvidia] about our project).

* [`s3push`](https://github.com/vduseev/s3push) *(Python)*

  Painless upload of directories to AWS S3 with extensive support of different credential sources.

* [`preserve-layout-plugin`](https://github.com/vduseev/preserve-layout-plugin) *(Java)*

  IntelliJ IDEA plugin that allows you to import and export menu layouts.

* [`jekyll-dry`](https://github.com/vduseev/jekyll-dry) *(Ruby)*

  Don't Repeat Yourself plugin for Jekyll that lets you reuse any content across your website.
